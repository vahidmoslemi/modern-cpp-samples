# modern-cpp-samples
A collection of modern C++ sample projects to demonstrate new features and their possible use-cases, Hope this will help modern C++ newbies. Compiled and tested under Fedora Linux x64 with g++ or simply using Qt Creator 4.10.0


Here I'll try to put sample codes and learning references which I have learned and tested to deep learning the Modern C++ concepts.

I'll do my best to publish samples which could be reusable in daily project and small enough to focus on the main subjects.

Please help me by your critics and encouraging comments.

Please fill free to ask your questions (Better to place in Stackoverflow website and inform me throw comments),
I'll try my best to answer any questions regarding the sample codes.
